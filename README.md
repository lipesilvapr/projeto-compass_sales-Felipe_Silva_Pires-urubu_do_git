The **Compass Sales** is a React Native project, made by **Felipe Silva Pires** from Squad 07 (Urubu do git). The main objective of this project is to be a registration app, which contains a Sign up, Log in, Forgot password and Home page, and all of them communicate with the Firebase database and authentication.

# All features

>**Note**: Make sure you have android studio or a mobile device to be albe to see the code in action.

## Tecnologies

1. React Native
2. TypeScript as main language
3. Stylesheet for styling components

## Starting the app

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ app:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

a
```
Or you can launch the emulator from de terminal like this:

### For Android

```bash

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or on your phisical device.
